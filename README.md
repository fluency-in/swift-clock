# Swift: Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

Create a clock that is independent of date.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

In order to use Swift, you must be running Xcode version 7.3 or greater which is available at [Apple's developer center][appledev].

The exercises use XCTest.

See [this guide][exercism-xcode-swift] for details about how to create the project in XCode and run the tests.
